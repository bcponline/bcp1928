			IT is a most invaluable part of that blessed “liberty wherewith Christ<nobr>
			hath made us free,” that in his worship different forms and usages may<nobr>
			without offence be allowed, provided the substance of the Faith be kept<nobr>
			entire; and that, in every Church, what cannot be clearly determined to<nobr>
			belong to Doctrine must be referred to Discipline; and therefore, by com-<nobr>
			mon consent and authority, may be altered, abridged, enlarged, amended,<nobr>
			or otherwise disposed of, as may seem most convenient for the edification<nobr>
			of the people, “according to the various exigency of times and occasions.”<nobr>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of England, to which the Protestant Episcopal Church in<nobr>
			these States is indebted, under God, for her first foundation and a long<nobr>
			continuance of nursing care and protection, hath, in the Preface of her<nobr>
			Book of Common Prayer, laid it down as a rule, that “The particular<nobr>
			Forms of Divine Worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to<nobr>
			be used therein, being things in their own nature indifferent, and alterable,<nobr>
			and so acknowledged; it is but reasonable that upon weighty and im-<nobr>
			portant considerations, according to the various exigency of times and<nobr>
			occasions, such changes and alterations should be made therein, as to those<nobr>
			that are in place of Authority should, from time to time, seem either<nobr>
			necessary or expedient.”<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Church hath not only in her Preface, but likewise in her<nobr>
			Articles and Homilies, declared the necessity and expediency of occasional<nobr>
			alterations and amendments in her Forms of Public Worship; and we<nobr>
			find accordingly, that, seeking to keep the happy mean between too much<nobr>
			stiffness in refusing, and too much easiness in admitting variations in<nobr>
			things once advisedly established, she hath, in the reign of several Princes,<nobr>
			since the first compiling of her Liturgy in the time of Edward the Sixth,<nobr>
			upon just and weighty considerations her there-unto moving, yielded to<nobr>
			make such alterations in some particulars, as in their respective times<nobr>
			were thought convenient; yet so as that the main body and essential parts<nobr>
			of the same (as well in the chiefest materials, as in the frame and order<nobr>
			thereof) have still been continued firm and unshaken.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;Her general aim in these different reviews and alterations hath been,<nobr>
			as she further declares in her said Preface, to do that which, according<nobr>
			to her best understanding, might most tend to the preservation of peace<nobr>
			and unity in the Church, the procuring of reverence, and the exciting<nobr>
			of piety and devotion in the worship of God; and, finally, the cutting<nobr>
			off occasion, from them that seek occasion, of cavil or quarrel against<nobr>
			her Liturgy. And although, according to her judgment, there be not<nobr>
			any thing in it contrary to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or<nobr>
			which a godly man may not with a good conscience use and submit<nobr>
			unto, or which is not fairly defensible, if allowed such just and<nobr>
			favourable construction as in common equity ought to be allowed to<nobr>

			all human writings; yet upon the principles already laid down, it cannot<nobr>
			but be supposed that further alterations would in time be found expedient.<nobr>
			Accordingly, a Commission for a review was issued in the year 1689: but<nobr>
			this great and good work miscarried at that time; and the Civil Authority<nobr>
			has not since thought proper to revive it by any new Commission.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States<nobr>
			became independent with respect to civil government, their ecclesiastical<nobr>
			independence was necessarily included; and the different religious de-<nobr>
			nominations of Christians in these States were left at full and equal liberty<nobr>
			to model and organize their respective Churches, and forms of worship,<nobr>
			and discipline, in such manner as they might judge most convenient for<nobr>
			their future prosperity; consistently with the constitution and laws of<nobr>
			their country.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those<nobr>
			alterations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for<nobr>
			our Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution. And the principal care<nobr>
			herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the proper end<nobr>
			of all such prayers, namely, that “Rulers may have grace, wisdom, and<nobr>
			understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth”; and that the<nobr>
			people “may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty.”<nobr>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they<nobr>
			could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which<nobr>
			was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly author-<nobr>
			ity whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service, and to estab-<nobr>
			lish such other alterations and amendments therein as might be deemed<nobr>
			expedient.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and<nobr>
			amendments. They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of<nobr>
			them also, upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer<nobr>
			of the Church of England. In which it will also appear that this Church<nobr>
			is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any<nobr>
			essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local<nobr>
			circumstances require.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is<nobr>
			hoped the whole will be received and examined by every true member of<nobr>
			our Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and chari-<nobr>
			table frame of mind; without prejudice or pre possessions; seriously con-<nobr>
			sidering what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are; and<nobr>
			earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing every<nobr>
			endeavour for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest, plainest,<nobr>
			most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our<nobr>
			blessed Lord and Saviour.<br/>

			Philadelphia, October, 1789.
